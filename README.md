# The Golden Gallop: 2026 Greeting Guide

An interactive Chinese New Year quiz for the Year of the Horse (2026). Navigate a reunion dinner by choosing the perfect greeting for each guest — from Ah Ma asking about marriage to Uncle Stephen flexing his marathon PB.

## How It Works

You're greeted by 32 dinner guests across 6 random rounds. Each round presents a character with a scenario and four greeting options in Mandarin. Pick the most appropriate one, earn hongbao, and build your streak.

At the end, you get a personalised scorecard with all your chosen greetings ready to copy and share.
